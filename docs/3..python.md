# CryptoPython

#### General Overview

BitcoinPy contracts are developed in Python. Period. There are no additional annotations or code gimmicks that you need to learn. One of the most important things for us was to make the use of smart contracts as simple as possible. The only restriction that applies is, that you cannot use all of the traditional modules that you find in most Python distributions. While you can use all the power that the language gives you, modules that would give you access to the filesystem, network or system functions are not present. In fact, the only module you can import and use is the Blockchain module. This works as simple as

```import blockchain```

or, if you want to reduce the file size (and the required fees for deploying the contract)

```import blockchain as b```

#### Blockchain Module

The Blockchain module is a module that can be imported and used by any smart contract. While it is not part of a standard Python distribution, you are advised to use our own Python interpreter (contractpython) to develop and test your smart contracts.

This is an overview of the entire functionality of the Blockchain module:

| Function or Object                               | Type           | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| blockchain.current\_height()              | Numeric        | The height of the block this transaction was included into   |
| blockchain.current\_time()                | Numeric        | The timestamp of the block this transaction was included into |
| blockchain.current\_block()                  | Hex String     | The hex encoded block hash of the current block              |
| blockchain.previous\_time()               | Numeric        | The timestamp of the previous block                          |
| blockchain.previous\_block()                 | Hex String     | The hex encoded block hash of the previousblock              |
| blockchain.value()                           | Numeric        | The GAS value that was submitted with this transaction in satoshis |
| blockchain.contract\_balance()                   | Numeric        | The contract's current balance in satoshis                   |
| blockchain.contract\_address()                        | Address String | The address of the contract                                  |
| blockchain._sender()                          | Address String | The address of the transaction's sender                      |
| blockchain.random()                              | Numeric        | A pseudo-random 32 bit integer that comes from a random number generator that was seeded using parameters from the current Bitcoin blockchain's state |
| blockchain.send(address, value)                  | Void           | This call makes the contract send "value" to "address" from its contract balance |
| blockchain.suicide(address)                      | Void           | This call sends the entire balance of the contract to "address" and suicides, i.e., makes the contract unusable in the future |
| blockchain.<br />assert\_address(address) | Void           | Allows you to check for the validity of a Bitcoin address. This call reverts the contract execution if an invalid address was provided. The caller just pays the GAS fees, but not the GAS amount he sent to the contract |
| blockchain.revert()                              | Void           | Reverts the contract execution. The caller just pays the GAS fees, but not the GAS amount he sent to the contract |

#### Permanent Storage

You can use the global dictionary ```store``` to store permanent data. An example, that just increases a counter every time the default function of the contract is executed, might look like this:

```
import blockchain as b

def default():
    if(store["test"]) == None:
        store["test"] = 0
    store["test"] += 0
```

Note that keys, that have no associated value in the permanent storage dictionary, will return ```None``` instead of throwing an exception.
