# Contract Virtual Machine


#### Balance Behavior

A user who calls a contract usually specifies two things. A "value" in GAS that he is sending to a contract (as a bet to our coin toss game for example, but it can be also 0) and a maximum "GAS fee", which is the maximum amount of GAS that he is willing to pay for the contract execution. Depending on the outcome of the contract execution, the user is either only paying the GAS fee, or paying the GAS fee plus the amount of GAS he is transferring to the contract. Here is a matrix that shows you all possible outcomes: 

| Event                                                        | What does the user pay         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Contract executes fine                                       | GAS fee<br />+ transferred GAS |
| Contract suicides                                            | GAS fee<br />+ transferred GAS |
| Contract cannot execute properly<br />and throws an exception | GAS fee                        |
| Contract reverts using<br />blockchain.revert()              | GAS fee                        |
| Contract cannot be called<br />(insufficient balance or contract dead) | Nothing                        |
